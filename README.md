# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of the PlanMyTrip app is to help users discover their next vacation destination based on their preferred criteria. The application is built using weather data of 600+ cities along with the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clientsâ€™ weather preferences.


### Summary

- The application then populates a recommended route and map with the cities based on min and max temperature
